physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Conformal-field theory (CFT) code'
short_name: 'CFT'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1611.07528,arxiv:2310.04710,arxiv:2406.09555}'

description: |
  Approximate code whose codewords lie in the low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory, e.g., the quantum Ising model at its critical point \cite{arxiv:1611.07528,arxiv:2406.09555}.
  Its encoding is argued to perform source coding (i.e., compression) as well as channel coding (i.e., error correction) \cite{arxiv:1611.07528}.

protection: |
  Code performance is quantified by a lower bound on the entanglement fidelity in terms of the conditional mutual information \cite[Eq. (9)]{arxiv:1611.07528}; see also \cite[Appx. A]{arxiv:1801.07271}.
  Certain CFT codes have indefinite \hyperref[topic:codespace-complexity]{codespace complexity}, and their protection depends on the minimum scaling dimension of the underlying CFT \cite{arxiv:2310.04710}.
  The coherent information of a combined noise and recovery channel can be perturbatively expanded \cite{arxiv:2406.09555}.
