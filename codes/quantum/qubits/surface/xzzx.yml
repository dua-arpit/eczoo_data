code_id: xzzx
name: XZZX surface code
description: Non-CSS derivative of the surface code whose generators are \(XZXZ\)
  Pauli strings associated, clock-wise, to the vertices of each face of a two-dimensional
  lattice (with a qubit located at each vertex of the tessellation).
introduced: "\\cite{arXiv:2009.07851}"
physical: qubits
logical: qubits
protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).
features:
  threshold:
  - Fault-tolerant minimum weight perfect matching threshold of $\sim$4.5\% for depolarizing
    noise (bias $\eta=0.5$) and $\sim$10% for infinite $Z$ bias.

    \(50\%\) threshold for noise infinitely biased towards \(X\) or \(Y\) or \(Z\) errors using a maximum-likelihood decoder

    \(18.7\%\) at standard depolarising noise with a maximum-likelihood decoder.

    Minimum weight perfect matching decoder can also be used for $X$ and $Z$ noise. For $Y$ noise, a variant of the matching decoder could be used like it is used here for the XY code. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.130501


    For large but finite \(X\)- or \(Z\)-biased noise, the code's thresholds exceed the zero-rate hashing bound.
    The gap exceeds \(2.9\%\) when \(X\) (\(Z\)) error is \(300\) times more frequent than other Paulis.
notes:
- Originally formulated as an example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the
  Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.
