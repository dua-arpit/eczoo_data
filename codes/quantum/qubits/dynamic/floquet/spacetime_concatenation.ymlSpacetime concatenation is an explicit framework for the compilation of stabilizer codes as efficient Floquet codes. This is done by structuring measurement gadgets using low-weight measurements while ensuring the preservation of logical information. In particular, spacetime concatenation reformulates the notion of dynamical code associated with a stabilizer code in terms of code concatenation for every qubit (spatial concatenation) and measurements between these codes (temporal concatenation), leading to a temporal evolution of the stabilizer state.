description: |Spacetime concatenation is an explicit framework for the compilation of stabilizer codes as efficient Floquet codes. This is done by structuring measurement gadgets using low-weight measurements while ensuring the preservation of logical information. In particular, spacetime concatenation reformulates the notion of dynamical code associated with a stabilizer code in terms of code concatenation for every qubit (spatial concatenation) and measurements between these codes (temporal concatenation), leading to a temporal evolution of the stabilizer state. 

  

protection: |A matrix rank condition on the bond operators connecting the gadgets, called the Bond-Kernel-Rank Condition, and a strict locality preservation condition (SLPC), along with preservation of the operator algebra of the stabilizer code under the gadget action, leads to preservation of the space-time distance of the code and hence, provide fault-tolerance

features: compiles any LDPC stabilizer code fault-tolerantly as a Floquet code
